## About the project

Maybe I exagerated a bit... This App was build in the context of an event called Next Level Week by Rocketseat.

The event is a one week long, crazy intense, deep dive into some technology by building a great project. This was the project on the React Track. Other tracks had different projects and the other 4 tracks were React Native, Flutter, NodeJs and Elixir.

This event serves as a stepping stone to introduce new developers to these technologies.

I like their designs and the intensity of it all so I will keep going to these events, as a Backender(PHP) it is a great way to expand my knowledge to the frontend realm as well.

This project was developed using cutting edge front-end technologies. That is also part of the Philosophy of the event, giving a great understanding of the current tech and best practices.
